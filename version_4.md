# Version 4

A WIP boardgame

## Guiding Principles

- Aesthetics: the physical components of the game should be pleasing; the game mechanics should lend themselves to an aesthetic presentation.
- Narrative: each play of the game should tell a different story. Players should feel an emotional attachment to the characters and events in the game. They should reminisce about the game after it ends. They should be focused on resolving situations, not gaming mechanics. The character and player know the same set of things about the game world.
- Challenge: the game should have strategic depth. No single strategy should dominate. Players should feel that creative plays, adaptation to circumstances, and long-term planning are rewarded.
- Competition: victory or defeat should never be certain. Players should feel that the winner earned victory.
- Abnegation: The barrier to entry should be low; it should be possible to play (though probably not to win) with a minimum of mental effort. Players should always know what their options are; they should never have to choose between more than a handful of options. It should be obvious from glancing at the board what the gamestate is. The load on players' working memory should be small. N.B. this does not mean the game has to be easyâ€”e.g. Go actually excels at abnegation by this metric, since you can "play" by just playing on any open intersection at random.
- Social interaction: players should be engaged during others' turns. Negotiation should be vital to the game.
- Social cohesion: it should be conceivable that gaming groups would form primarily to play this game.
- Brevity: The game should not outstay its welcome. Playtime should be adjustable by slight tweaks to the rules, goal states, or initial conditions. 20-30 minutes per player is probably about right.

## User Stories

As a Player, I want to have cooperative and competitive goals that conflict, so I can bluff and negotiate with the other players.

As a Player, I want to play a game that tells a unique and exciting story each time, so I can enjoy replaying the game and reminiscing about past plays.

As a Player, I want strategic and tactical decision points that keep me engaged without being overwhelming.

As a Spectator, I want dramatic irony, so the game is entertaining and suspenseful.

## Thematic Concepts

- The game spans several generations. Young player characters grow up, receive training, choose a class, and eventually succeed their mentors. Characters can grow old and retire. Death is permanent.

- Some concept of faction, character class, magic school, or alignment

- Wandering monsters or other NPC encounters that can involve combat, trade, or diplomacy.

## Mechanical Concepts

- **Everyone is a DM:** Players trade off the responsibility of making life interesting for each other. Maybe there's some bidding mechanic that lets players put a price on control of the NPCs in each encounter. Conflict and negotiation should arise from the players' conflicting goals, not from some dumb AI built into the game.

## Empirical Metrics

- Playtime
- Player engagement / playtime (meaningful actions taken when it's not "your turn").
- # of times players swear, laugh, gloat, cheer, cry during the game.
- time taken for rules explanation
- time difference between first playthrough w/ new players and a typical playthrough with experienced players
- Subjective ratings by playtesters

## Theoretical Metrics

- Game-theoretic strategic analysis
- Narrative entropy (number of possible stories generated)

## Mechanics

### Encounters

When a new hex tile is added to the board, place one GP on it.

When any PC enters a tile with GP on it, they take all the GP and an *encounter* begins. Hereafter in this section, the player controlling this PC is referred to as "The Player", and the other players are "DMs".

An *encounter* consists of the following phases:

1. **Bidding:** The DMs place secret bids for the ability to run the encounter. The winner of the bid is hereafter referred to as "The DM". If two or more DMs tie for the highest bid, the player chooses how to break the tie.
2. **Encounter Setup:** The DM checks the page of the Encounter Guide corresponding to the tile entered by the PC. She chooses monsters and items to add to the encounter, subject to the restrictions in the Encounter Guide. Restrictions are dependent on the number of GP on the tile when the PC entered it. Higher GP amounts allow more and stronger monsters and items in the encounter.
3. **Encounter Resolution:** The DM plays the part of the NPCs or monsters, negotiating or fighting on their behalf. Encounter resolution may result in the PC hiring the monsters, fighting them, bribing them to leave peacefully, or buying their items. All exchanges up to the start of combat occur transactionally and must be approved by both the player and DM. Combat can be unilaterally started by either side. Combat may end when either the PC or the monsters are dead, or when the PC retreats. The monsters may retreat if their case is hopeless, but the DM gains nothing but time from this; the monsters leave their items behind. There can be no negotiation after combat. When combat ends, the encounter proceeds immediately to step 4.
4. **Encounter Teardown:** If the PC defeated the monsters in combat, he is entitled to all the items and resources in the encounter, including items added by the DM and resources the PC may have given to the monsters before starting combat. Otherwise, the DM takes any items not traded to the PC, as well as any resources or items traded or given to the monsters by the PC. She may not take the monsters themselves, however; undefeated monsters are returned to the Source. If the monsters are victorious in combat, the DM takes the contents of the PC's inventory.
5. **Encounter Seeding:** The DM distributes the GP she bid over the map. She may place any number of GP on any tile that does not contain a PC or a city.
