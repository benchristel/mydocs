# Version 4

## Foundational Concepts

### Character Class

Each character in the game has a class, which represents their skillset at the start of the game. Each class has a special ability which is noted on the player board for that class. The special abilities are:

Paladin: When persuading a Good creature to join your army, you need only match the current highest bid to win the creature's loyalty.
Mage: Recover 2 mana during your Rest phase instead of 1
Necromancer: Recover 1 black mana each time a creature in your army falls in combat. If the last creature in your army dies, gain 1 black mana.
Sorcerer: When instructed to spend mana, you may instead lose one mana of the required color.
Ranger: You may move through forests during your Move phase. If you do, your Move phase ends.
Barbarian: You may move through mountains during your Move phase. If you do, your Move phase ends.

### Mana

**Mana** tokens represent your character's knowledge and power in various schools of magic and martial arts. Mana is gained as your character fights battles and explores the world.

Your character's mana can be in one of two states: *ready* or *spent*. Ready mana tokens are placed on the right side of the player board, and spent tokens on the left side. When instructed to *spend* mana, move it from the right to the left. When instructed to *recover* mana, move it from left to right. To *gain* mana means to take a new mana token from the Source and add it to your pool of ready mana. To *lose* mana means to return one ready mana token to the Source. If you have no ready mana when instructed to lose mana, spent mana is lost instead.

Mana comes in six colors: purple, blue, black, red, green, and gold. Each character class starts out with mana of a single color, although any character can gain and use any color of mana. The pairing of classes and starting mana is:

Paladin - purple
Mage - blue
Necromancer - black
Sorcerer - red
Ranger - green
Barbarian - gold

### Creatures

Creatures are the sentient beings—some human, some not—that inhabit the world outside the Citadel. 

### Towns

## Turn Phases

On your turn, execute the following phases in order.

1. **Rest.** Recover 1 mana.
2. **Event.** Draw an event card from the Source and read it out loud. It may affect all players.
3. **Move.** Move your character token one or 2 hexes. You may place a Travel token of your color on each hex you enter. To place a travel token, spend 1 mana for each opponent's travel token already on the hex. If there are no travel tokens on the hex yet, place your token without spending mana. You may not place a travel token on a hex where you have one already.

  Some hexes let you take an action when you enter them, whether or not you place a travel token. Some hexes require you to place a travel token in order to gain the benefit of that hex. Some hexes let you place a token, but only give you a benefit when you remove the token. Still others grant a one-time benefit; once your token is placed there, it is never removed.

4. **Adventure.** You may do one, but not both, of the following:
  - **Dungeon Crawl.** If your character token is on a hex with a dungeon, you may venture into that dungeon in an attempt to gain gold and combat experience.
  - **Explore.** If your character token is adjacent to an unexplored hex, you may place a new map tile from the layout to cover that hex. You may only place a tile in such a way that your character could move onto it in one step from his/her current position, respecting impassable terrain. Place a dungeon marker on the new tile, on the hex with the dungeon icon.

    If you can demonstrate that it is impossible for you to legally place any of the tiles in the layout, you may take one Treasure card, return the tiles in the layout to the Source, and replace them with new ones.
