# Soy Sauce Lentil Soup

Easy, delicious, and vegan without even trying!

Serves 2. I usually triple this recipe.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup rice
- 1 cup green or French lentils
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp mirin (sweet rice wine)
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- about 1 carrot, diced
- about 1 stalk of celery, diced
- something spicy: red pepper flakes, spicy chilis, or chili oil

## Optional-ish Ingredients

These are not strictly required, but make the result more delicious.

- onion or scallion, diced
- kale or some other dark leafy green, stems removed, cut into ~1 inch strips or squares
- mushrooms, sliced

## Procedure

1. Put all ingredients, except the rice, mushrooms, and leafy greens, in a large pot.
2. Saute things a bit, then cover with boiling water and bring to a simmer. The lentils will expand as they cook;
   add more water as needed to keep them covered. You'll end up needing about 4 cups of water per cup of dry lentils.
4. Start cooking the rice.
5. Cook the mushrooms in a pan: dry-saute them until they start to shrink a bit and change color; then add a bit of oil.
   After 15 minutes, add a splash of soy sauce and mirin and continue to cook.
5. When the soup has been simmering for 30 minutes or so, add the greens and cook for 10-15 minutes more.
6. Add mushrooms to the soup.
7. Divide rice into bowls and ladle the soup over it.

Lentils lower your blood sugar; to counteract that, I recommend pairing this recipe with ice cream.
