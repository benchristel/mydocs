# Butternut Squash Soup


## Ingredients

- 1 large butternut squash
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 sweet onion
- vegetable stock
- nutmeg
- salt & pepper

## Procedure

1. Cut the butternut squash into one-inch cubes. Dice onion.
2. Saute the onion with melted butter in a large pot until it is somewhat caramelized, 10-15 minutes.
3. Add butternutsquash cubes, then vegetable stock until stock covers butternut squash cubes.
4. Add nutmet, salt, and pepper. 
5. Simmer for 20 minutes.
6. Remove butternut squash cubes, which should be soft by now, and puree in blender.
7. Return butternut squash puree to pot and simmer for 5 minutes.

## Notes

May need more salt than you think.

This requires a blender. Be careful moving butternut squash to and from blender. It will be hot! If cubes are not blending evenly, add some liquid from pot, and stir vertically with a wooden spoon between blend attempts.

This goes well with a firm protein, like a grilled cheese sandwich, or a ham and cheese sandwich if you are a meat-eater.
