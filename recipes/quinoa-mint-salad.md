# Quinoa Mint Salad

## Ingredients

- 2 cups dry quinoa, washed and drained
- dressing
	- 1/4 cup orange muscat vinegar
	- 1/2 cup olive oil
	- rind and juice of one lemon
	- salt
	- pepper
- onion, chopped
- green beans, cut into 1" pieces
- carrot, thinly sliced
- fennel bulb, thinly sliced and chopped
- 1/2 cup raisins
- mint, chopped

## Procedure

1. Cook the quinoa in 3 cups salted water, about 15 minutes
2. While the cooked quinoa is still warm, add the dressing and mix.
3. Steam the green beans 8-10 minutes or until tender.
4. Saute onion and fennel in 1 tbsp oil.
5. Mix the quinoa, onion, fennel, raisins, and carrots. Garnish with chopped mint. Serve at room temperature.

## Notes

This is delicious leftover -- the onions get sweeter as they soak up the oil and vinegar.
