# Pumpkin Muffins

My mother's recipe. Makes at least 12 medium-sized muffins, plus a small loaf.

## Dry Ingredients

- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 3/4 cup white flour
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp ground clove

## Wet Ingredients

- 4 eggs
- 15 oz canned pumpkin puree
- 3/4 cup canola oil
- 1/4 cup buttermilk or 1/2 cup nonfat plain yogurt
- 1/2 tsp orange oil or zest

The amounts here are forgiving: you can use 3 eggs instead of 4, or reduce the oil to 1/2 cup and add more buttermilk.

## Tasty Bits (optional, but not really optional)

- Chocolate chips
- Chopped pecans
- Raisins

## Procedure

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Whisk the wet ingredients together.
3. Sift the dry ingredients into the wet.
4. Stir just until the dry ingredients are incorporated. Don't overmix, or you'll have tough muffins.
5. Fold in optional ingredients, no more than 1 cup total.
6. Divide into paper muffin cups and a greased loaf pan.
7. Bake muffins for ~25 minutes, the loaf for 30–35 minutes. They're done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
8. Cool 5 minutes in the pan and then remove and place on a rack to cool further.
9. Freeze if it will take you more than a couple days to consume them.
