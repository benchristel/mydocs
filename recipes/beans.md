# Beans

## Ingredients

- 1 cup black beans, dry
- 1 cup pinto beans, dry
- 1 or 2 zucchini, diced
- 1 or 2 onions, chopped
- 1 or 2 bell peppers, diced
- 1/2 tsp cajun spice mix
- 1/4 tsp salt

## Procedure

1. _In the morning:_ Soak the beans for 8 hours in 10 cups of water.
2. Bring the beans, still in their soaking water, to a boil. Add the onions. Start the timer.
3. At T = 45 minutes, add the zucchini.
4. At T = 1 hour, add the bell peppers.
5. At T = 1.5 hours, the beans should be done. Season and serve over quinoa or rice.

## Notes

Cooking black and pinto beans together was an experiment, but I think it turned out well. The pintos seemed to get done first, and after an hour and a half most of them were quite exploded. Still, this is astonishingly good for how simple it is.
