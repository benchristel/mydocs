# Chickpea Melba Toast

Ingredients:

- Bread
- Chickpeas (3 cup can)
- Yogurt (Greek?) (1 cup)
- Tomatoes (15oz can, or a couple fresh), diced
- Cucumber, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic
- Cinnamon (~1.5 tsp)
- Nutmeg (0.5 tsp)
- Paprika (1 tsp)
- Olive oil
- Juice + zest from about half a lemon
- Black pepper
- Red pepper flakes?
- Pine nuts?
- Parsley?
- Mint?
- Sesame seeds or tahini?

Procedure:

To make melba toast, toast slices of bread until lightly browned, cut off the crusts, cut each slice into two thinner slices, and toast again.

Saute the garlic, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, and paprika in olive oil for 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, sugar, and salt, and cook about 5 minutes. Add the chickpeas. Mash them slightly so they will stick to the toast. In a bowl, mix cucumber, lemon juice, and yogurt.

Serve chickpeas piled on melba toast, with lemon juice and yogurt mixture on top.

Garnish with pine nuts, olive oil, parsley, or mint (?)

Notes:

Made with non-greek yogurt, the topping was pretty runny. With strong nutmeg, 0.5 tsp is a bit too much.
