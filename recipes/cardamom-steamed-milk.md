# Cardamom Steamed Milk

Invented by my dear mommy.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk
- 1/8 tsp ground cardamom
- 1/4 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp sugar

## Procedure

Mix all ingredients. Heat while whisking vigorously, or steam with a cappucino steamer.

## Notes

This is freaking amazing. It could possibly be made as mock sahlep by adding a couple teaspoons of tapioca flour or ground arrowroot.
