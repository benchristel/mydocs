# Japanese Curry with Fried Eggplant

## Ingredients

- 2 large eggplants, cut into 1 cm slices
- 1 large onion, sliced thinly
- 4-6 carrots, diced
- 5 potatoes, diced
- celery
- 4 tbsp S&B curry powder (in the Asian foods aisle at Safeway)
- 8 oz butter
- 1/2 cup flour (for roux)
- 1/2 cup flour (for breading)
- panko
- 2 eggs, beaten
- rice
- oil
- salt

## Procedure

The first four steps can be done in parallel if you have enough cooks and kitchen space.
1. Bread the eggplant slices in flour, egg, and panko. Fry until tender.
2. Saute the onions in a large pot until they are completely caramelized, 20-30 minutes. Add the curry powder and saute for about 30 seconds more. Add water, carrots, and celery, and bring to a boil. After several minutes, add the potatoes, adding more water as necessary to cover all the veggies. Simmer 20-30 minutes.
3. Melt the butter in a saucepan. When hot, add the flour and stir to form a roux. Keep it gently bubbling, stirring constantly, until it turns golden brown.
4. Cook the rice.
5. When the potatoes and carrots are cooked, add the roux to the pot with veggies, and bring to a boil briefly to thicken. Salt and adjust.

Serve in layers - rice on the bottom, eggplant in the middle, curry on top.

## Notes

Noah and I made this on 2015-03-01. We considered baking the eggplant after frying it, but ended up deciding not to, and I think it worked out well. The eggplant ended up firm but not rubbery, and had an interestingly vegetal taste.

A silicone spatula works well for stirring the roux.
