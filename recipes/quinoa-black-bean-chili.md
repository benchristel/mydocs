Serves 10

## Ingredients

- 1 cup raw quinoa
- 1.5 cups water
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp ancho chili powder
- 1 tbsp cumin
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 jalapeño pepper, minced
- 2 bell peppers, chopped
- 1 sweet potato, diced
- 3-4 zucchini, diced
- 28 oz can crushed tomatoes
- 2 28 oz cans of black beans
- 1 cup frozen corn
- veggie sausages, cut up and sautéed.

## Procedure

1. Cook the quinoa in the water. 
2. Saute the onions, garlic, jalapeño, spices, and fresh veggies. 
3. Add the tomatoes and simmer until the sweet potato is cooked through. 
4. Add the beans, let them get warm.
5. Add the corn, and turn off the heat once it's cooked.
6. Add the quinoa to the chili.
7. Turn off the heat and add the cooked sausage bits. Don't let them boil, or they'll get tough.

## Notes

Can be made without adding any salt. I like it that way! Could use some lime, though.
