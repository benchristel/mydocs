Adapted from http://allrecipes.com/recipe/quinoa-and-black-bean-chili/

Serves 10

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 3 jalapeño peppers, minced
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 1 tbsp ancho chili powder
- 1 tbsp cumin
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 sweet potato, diced
- 3-4 zucchini, diced
- 2 bell peppers, chopped
- 28 oz can crushed tomatoes
- 2 28 oz cans of black beans, or 1 lb dry, cooked
- 1 cup raw quinoa
- 1 cup frozen corn
- 1 lb veggie meat, cut up and sautéed. Impossible burger works well.

## Ideas for Toppings and Sides

- Shredded pepper jack cheese
- Chips
- Sour cream
- Pickled jalapeños
- Avocado
- Cilantro
- Corn bread

## Procedure

1. In a large pot, saute the onions, garlic, jalapeño, spices, and fresh veggies. 
1. Add the tomatoes and simmer until the sweet potato is cooked through. 
1. Add the beans, let them get warm. Cover with water and bring to a boil.
1. 15 minutes before serving, add the raw quinoa. Keep adding water to cover.
1. Add the corn, and turn off the heat once it's warm.
1. Add the cooked veggie meat bits to individual servings. Don't add them to the chili, or they'll be soggy leftover.

## Notes

Can be made without adding any salt. I like it that way! Could use some lime, though.
