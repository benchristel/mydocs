## Procedure - Chili

1. In a large pot, saute the onions, garlic, jalapeño, spices, and sweet potato. 
2. Add the tomatoes and water to cover the veggies, and simmer until the sweet potato is cooked through.
3. Add the other veggies.
4. Add the beans, let them get warm. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Salt.
5. 15 minutes before serving, add the raw quinoa. Keep adding water to cover.
6. Add the corn, and turn off the heat once it's warm.

## Procedure - Veggie Meat

1. Mince a few green onions and saute in a bit of oil.
2. When the onions are soft, add the veggie meat. You can break it up into nibbles in the pan as it cooks.
   Stir-fry 7-10 minutes.
3. Don't add the veggie meat directly to the chili, or it will be soggy leftover. Store it separately and add
   it to individual servings before reheating.
