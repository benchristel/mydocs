This is not very authentic, but it's tasty!

## Ingredients

- 1 cup green lentils
- 1 small onion
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp coriander
- 1/2 tsp tumeric
- salt
- raisins or other dried fruit to taste

## Procedure

1. Remove any stones from the lentils and bring them to a boil in a saucepan.
1. Chop and sauté the onion in a large stainless steel or cast-iron pan. Salt vigorously.
1. When the onion is browning, add the spices and sauté 30 seconds more.
1. Transfer the lentils into the pan with the onions.
1. Add raisins.
1. Simmer 2 hours, stirring every few minutes, and adding more hot water to cover the lentils as needed.
1. Adjust seasoning and serve over brown rice.

## Notes

The cooking time for this is roughly the same as the time it takes my rice cooker to make brown rice.
