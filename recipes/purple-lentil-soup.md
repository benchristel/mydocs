# Purple Lentil Soup

Serves maybe 8 if you have a side dish. 6 if it's a one-pot
meal.

## Ingredients

- 1 yellow onion
- olive oil (regular for cooking, extra virgin for garnish)
- 3 stalks celery
- 1 carrot
- 2 cups lentils (green, or a mix green and red. If using
  both green and red lentils, cook the red ones separately,
  since they'll cook much faster)
- vegetable stock
- 1 large purple sweet potato
- 1 large zucchino
- a bunch of swiss chard (it cooks down)
- 10 or so leaves fresh lavender
- 10 inches or so fresh oregano
- 2 bay leaves
- a splash of red wine vinegar
- 2 tbsp red wine
- black pepper
- 2 tsp salt

## Procedure

1. Sauté diced onion in olive oil in a large pot. When it
   starts to brown, add carrots and celery. Salt and pepper.
2. After a couple minutes, add the lentils and water or
   stock, and bring to a boil.
3. Add the sweet potato, cubed.
4. Add the other seasonings: lavender, oregano, bay,
   vinegar, and wine. Chop the oregano and lavender finely.
5. When the lentils have about 15 minutes left to cook, add
   the zucchini.
6. Separate the chard stems from the leaves. Dice and sauté
   the stems separately.
7. When the lentils have about 5 minutes left to cook, add
   the precooked chard stems and the leaves, cut crosswise
   into ribbons. By this time, the potato should be
   disintegrating slightly, thickening the soup.
