# Macaroons

## Hardware

- Food processor with a sharp blade

## Ingredients

- 2 cups raw almonds
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup sugar
- orange zest

## Procedure Act 1: T -12 hours

- Blanch the almonds by dropping them into boiling water for
  exactly 60 seconds. Any longer and they'll start to
  soften. Drain and run under cold water to cool.
- Peel the skins off the almonds and let them dry
  completely.
- Grind the almonds into a fine meal in a food processor.
- Add the other ingredients and pulse until the dough is
  cohesive.
- Refrigerate, covered, for 12 hours.

## Procedure Act 2

- Form the dough into flattened balls.
- Arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
- Bake at 350ºF for 8–10 minutes, just until starting to
  turn golden. The macaroons should still be soft when
  removed from the oven; they'll harden as they cool.
