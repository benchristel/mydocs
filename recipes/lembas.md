# Lembas (Coimas)

## Ingredients
- 1.5 c. (150 g) white flour
- 1.5 c. (180 g) blanched almonds
  (purchase them blanched, or blanch them yourself and then dry them out in an oven at low heat, and let them cool thoroughly before using. Freshly blanched almonds will throw off the moisture balance of the recipe. Using blanched slivered almonds will not change the volume measurements!)
- 1 tbsp. sugar
- a pinch of fine sea salt
- 3 tbsp. (48 g.) butter
- 4 tbsp. (2 oz.) water

**optional:**
- 1/4 tsp ground cardamom or finely grated lemon zest

## Procedure

Makes 16 wafers.

Preheat the oven to 400°F.

Grind the almond and flour together in a blender or food processor until most of it is very fine, and none of the almond bits are larger than fine (raw) couscous. Make sure to grind in pulses, shaking the mixture together between each, or else the almonds will get oily. Aim for a loose, cream colored meal that is not much heavier in appearance than flour. Almost like cornmeal or semolina. If there are a few larger chunks of almonds that the blades have missed, pick them out as you find them.

Add the salt, any optional flavoring and then cut in the butter until it disappears. Add the water and stir the mixture until it comes together. Using enough flour to keep it from sticking, knead the mixture just a bit and then roll it out to 1/4 of an inch thick. Using a knife, cut it into 3 inch x 3 inch squares. Gather up the scraps and re-roll and cut out squares until you’ve used up all the dough. Place the squares half an inch apart on an unlined baking sheet. Bake until the edges are golden brown. About 15-20 minutes. Do not underbake, or they will not be crisp. The edges will be a medium golden brown and the top will be a blond color. The bottom will be a little darker than the edges. Place on a rack to cool, and then place in a tin or individually wrap.
