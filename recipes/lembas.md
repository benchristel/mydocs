# Lembas (Coimas)

Source: <cite>[yclept](http://everything2.com/title/lembas)</cite>.

Take a double-handful of blanched almonds, and the same amount of flour, and grind the almonds and flour well together into a fine meal. Add a tablespoon of sugar and three of butter, a pinch of salt and three of ground cardamom. Cut the butter into the mixture. When it is fully incorporated, mix in water a spoonful at a time to form dough. Knead a few times on a floured board, roll out to a finger's thickness, and cut into squares measuring a finger's length. Bake at 400Â°F for about 15-20 minutes, until the edges of the wafers are golden.

To blanch raw almonds, drop them first into boiling water and then into cold. Dry them and rub the skins off. Let them dry thoroughly before using them in lembas.
