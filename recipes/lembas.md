# Lembas (Coimas)

Source: <cite>[yclept](http://everything2.com/title/lembas)</cite>.

Take a cup and a half of blanched almonds, and the same amount of flour, and grind the almonds and flour well together into a fine meal. Add a tablespoon of sugar and three of butter, a pinch of salt and three of ground cardamom. Cut the butter into the mixture. When it is fully incorporated, mix in half a cup of water a spoonful at a time to form dough. Knead a few times on a floured board, roll out to a finger's thickness, and cut into squares measuring a finger's length. Bake at 400째F for about 15-20 minutes, until the edges of the wafers are golden.

To blanch raw almonds, drop them first into boiling water and then into cold. Dry them and rub the skins off. Let them dry thoroughly before using them in lembas.

## Notes

My first time making this (2015-01-31), I made several mistakes.

1. I used salted butter.
2. I baked the lembas in a convection oven set to 400째F. The actual temperature was probably closer to 450째F.
3. I used almond flour instead of grinding my own; the resulting meal was possibly too coarse.
4. I added only a quarter-cup of water. This was fine for dough consistency, but possibly a contributing factor to the burnination.

The end result was that the lembas came out burned and dry. Almond oil smokes at 420째F, so the taste was dominated by burned oil. Given that my oven is pretty bad at maintaining a constant temperature, I might try baking these at a lower set temperature to be on the safe side; probably 350F in a convection oven.

I want these to be bicuitier somehow. Some cornmeal, sesame seeds, or honey might not go amiss.
