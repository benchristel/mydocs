# Lembas (Coimas)

Tolkien's Elvish languages aren't particularly rich in food vocabulary; we know words for "bread" and "meat" and not much else. The Etymologies of _The Lost Road_ yield at least one more interesting entry, though: _ferna_, the Quenya word for "beechnuts". This struck me as a pretty low-probability food word to have in one's lexicon, so I naturally began to speculate as to the possible significance of the beechnut in Middle-earth lore.

In LOTR _lembas_ is described as being crisp, wafer-like, and unexpectedly delicious. I imagine something akin to macarons, which are made from almond flour. I wondered—could the Etymologies' reference to beechnuts point to a _lembas_ recipe that included tree nuts? Beechnuts might well be a staple of a forest-dwelling people, and lembas could plausibly be made of beechnuts, eggs, honey, and little else.

However, given the rarity of beechnuts in American grocery stores, I've had to stick to almonds for this recipe.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups raw almonds
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 large egg

## Preparation

### Act One: 12 hours ahead

1. Blanch the almonds by dropping them into boiling water for 60 seconds. When time's up, drain them immediately and run cold water over them. If the almonds boil too long they'll start to soften. Peel the skins off and let dry.
2. Grind the almonds into a fine meal in a food processor
3. Add egg, sugar and honey, and pulse until a cohesive dough forms.
4. Refrigerate the dough for at least 12 hours.

### Act Two

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll dough into balls and smush them onto the baking sheet. Bake 8–10 minutes—_lembas_ should be golden-brown but still soft when removed from the oven.
