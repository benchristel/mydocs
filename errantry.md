# Errantry

## Overview

During the game, your hero character will make several **errands**, journeys around the board that start and end at the Citadel. The object of the game is to defeat three monsters in a single errand.

## Basic Concepts

**The Source** is a repository for the game components that are not owned or controlled by any one player. It's analogous to the Bank in Monopoly. Unless otherwise stated, game components reside in the Source at setup time. Be sure to keep your personal stash of tokens, cards, etc. separate from the Source.

**Tiles** represent the landscape your hero will travel through. Tiles usually contain two **hexes**—the exception is the Citadel tile, which is a single hex.

**Hexes** are the hexagonal spaces that make up the board. Each hex costs one "move" to enter. At the beginning of the game, you get 3 moves per turn, so you can move a total of 3 hexes on your turn. The edges of hexes can be marked with either **roads** or **impassable terrain**. Unless otherwise stated, you may only move along roads and may not move out of a hex across impassable terrain. Impassable terrain is marked on hexes by a wavy line at the edge of the hex.

**Mana** represents your hero's mental and physical energy. Your hero board has two areas, called **orbs**, for storing mana tokens. Mana in the left orb is **spent** and can't immediately be used. Mana in the right orb is **ready** and can be **spent** on various actions. When instructed to spend mana, move mana from the right orb to the left orb. When instructed to **recover** mana, move it from left to right so it is **ready** once again. To **gain** mana means to add a new mana token from the Source to the right orb. To **lose** mana is the opposite—return ready mana back to the Source. If you have no ready mana when instructed to lose mana, you lose spent mana instead.

## Setup

Place the Citadel tile in the center of the table. Players decide through some random or arbitrary means who will take the first turn in the setup round. Starting with that player and going around the table, do the following steps:

1. Draw two terrain tiles from the Source and place them so that each tile is connected by a road to the Citadel.
2. Place your hero token on a hex on one of the terrain tiles you placed.

## Gameplay

The game takes place over a number of rounds, called **days**, in which players first determine turn order and then take their turns in that order.

### Day Phases

Each **day**, the following things happen in order:

1. Determine Turn Order
2. Player Turns
3. End of Day

#### Determining Turn Order

In this phase, players determine who will move first this day, who will move second, and so on. It's advantageous to move first because doing so gives you first pick of map locations that get more expensive to use as more players use them. However, moving last one day means you get first pick of when to move the next day.

Starting with the player who moved last the previous day, and proceeding backwards through the previous day's turn order, players move their turn order token to the turn order space of their choice. Each space may only be chosen by one player. When moving turn order tokens, place them on the "full" side of the hourglass icon to mark that the token is indicating the turn order for the upcoming day.

#### Player Turns

Each player now takes a turn in the order determined in the previous phase. Turns are covered below.

#### End of Day

Draw a monster card from the source. The card

### Turn Phases

During the Player Turns phase of each Day, the players each take a turn in the order indicated on the turn order track. Turns consist of the following phases:

1. Rest
2. Move
3. Combat

#### Rest

Retrieve your movement tokens from the map and return them to your player board. You may choose to leave tokens on hexes with an "end of errand" effect. If you do, the end of errand effect will occur when you return to the Citadel.

If any cards or terrain hexes take effect during your rest phase, resolve those effects.

#### Move

Move your hero token up to 3 hexes, following roads. You may place a movement token on each hex you move into by spending a number of mana equal to the number of other players' movement tokens already in that hex. If there are no tokens in that hex, you spend no mana. You may not have more than one of your own movement tokens on the same hex.

If you enter the Citadel during your Move phase, your current errand ends and you perform the end-of-errand phase (below).

If you end your Move phase on a hex with a monster token, you may choose to initiate combat with the monster. If you do, proceed to the Combat phase.

#### Combat

Each monster token indicates a combat strength value and a number of dice. Roll the number of dice indicated, and add the total to the monster's combat strength. The result is the monster's total strength.

To compute your total strength, add the following:
- your hero's strength stat
- your bonuses from items
- bonuses from hexes on which you have a movement token.

You may increase your total strength in the current combat by spending mana. You get a +1 bonus for each mana token you spend.

##### If you win a combat

Take the treasure cards from the box on the treasure board corresponding to the monster's level (1-4). Draw two new treasure cards from the source and add them to the treasure board. Keep the treasure cards in ascending order of value, so the lowest-value cards are in the level 1 box, the next lowest are in the level 2 box, and so on.

##### If you lose a combat

If you can't beat the monster, return all treasure and trophies you've collected on your current errand to the Source. Return all your movement tokens to your player board and put your hero token on the Citadel hex. Your current errand ends and you execute an end-of-errand phase.

#### Visiting the Citadel

When you enter the Citadel, your current errand ends. You may not move further this turn. However, you may trade treasures for items at the city's marketplace, and exchange trophies for mana. You may stay in the Citadel for multiple turns and buy items on each turn.

##### Buying Items

Each turn in which you end your movement phase in the Citadel, you may buy up to two items from the marketplace by paying their cost in resources to the Source. You may also sell as many items as you wish. If you sell an item on the same turn that you bought it, you recoup its full cost. Otherwise, you can only sell the item for the circled resources on its card. Sold items go into the item discard pile, which is reshuffled into the item deck if the latter ever runs out.

Immediately after buying an item from the Marketplace, deal out a new item card from the Source to the Marketplace.

You can repeatedly buy and resell items to cycle through the item deck and find the item you want. However, this is very time-intensive.

##### Leveling Up

When you enter the Citadel, return all monster tokens you've defeated to the Source. For each monster, you gain 1 mana.

## End of the Game

The game ends when a hero arrives in the Citadel having defeated three monsters on his/her current errand. The player who accomplishes this feat is the winner.
