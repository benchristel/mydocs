# The First Scroll: Introduction

## What is Magic?

When people use the word *magic*, they are usually talking about a mechanism whose behavior they can describe but whose inner workings they cannot or do not care to explain. This definition applies equally well to stage magic (in which magicians seem to perform impossible feats by using techniques unknown to their audience), to fictional wizardry (which produces consistent effects, though its underlying mechanism is not usually explained), and to modern technology (which most people use but no one fully understands).

## What is Programming?

_Programming_ is the creation of magic using a computer.

There are many non-magical things you can create with a computer. You probably already know how to create images, documents, and videos. These things aren't magic, because there's no hidden mechanism behind them. What you see when you open up a text document or video file is all you get.

A computer program, on the other hand, is more than the sum of its parts. Because its inner mechanisms are concealed, it can be used and appreciated by people who don't understand how those mechanisms work. It can be used for purposes that its author never imagined, and it can generate experiences that weren't explicitly baked into its structure. That makes programming more powerful—and, in my mind, more fun—than anything else you can do with a computer.

The second-most-fun thing you can do with a computer is play games, so this book will focus on programming computer games.
