# Metascroll of the Apprentice

_Scrolls of the Apprentice_ is a project that I started in order to introduce programming to young people with an aptitude for the subject but no interest in it, or an interest in it but no aptitude.

The motivational strategy uses a combination of humanist mysticism and video games. The pedagogical strategy involves a steady learning curve with plenty of examples, and spoiler boxes that give more in-depth information for students who really want to know why something works the way it does. These scrolls are written in Github-Flavored Markdown, which doesn't support spoiler boxes directly. I have used block quotes in place of spoiler boxes in the Markdown version of the text.

## Why _Scrolls_?

Anything with a _scrollbar_ can (should?) be called a _scroll_.

It also fits well with the wizardry-flavored text.

## Why Wizardry?

As a kid in school, I felt (and still feel) that many difficult subjects could be made less onerous if the hard bits were presented as "we don't know how to make this easy yet; maybe you can do better". I also believe that one of the things that turns young people away from math is not that the concepts are hard, but that the notation is terrifying. I have no problem pushing Ruby enumerables through all manner of transformations, but I still find parsing a page of sigma notation laborious (this is probably a matter of relative familiarity rather than anything wrong with sigma notation, but I think the more pronounceable interface of Ruby does make it easier to grasp). I want to empower students to invent their own notations and abstractions by telling them early and often that language is arbitrary and I don't have all the answers. This isn't just a pedagogical concern; it's central to the material I'm trying to teach. When mediocre programmers meet stupefying notation, they study it carefully and struggle through; when great programmers meet stupifying notation, they struggle only until they can shove the mess behind an interface and forget about it.

Oh, you asked about wizards? I like wizards.
