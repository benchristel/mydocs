The board is built from a set of hex tiles that represent locations.
Each location may have a resource type, a unit type, and a set of actions that characters can perform when visiting that location.
- If a location has a resource type, one resource token of that type is added to the location every turn. A player visiting that location may take the available tokens
- If a location has actions that can be performed there, a player visiting that location may perform one of the actions
- If a location has a unit type, a player visiting that location may take one unit of that type into his hand from the draft piles.

Turn phases:
During any of these phases, you may discard a card from your hand to use its ability, if the ability is relevant to the current phase.

- Movement: move your character one space. You may move additional spaces by spending 1 food resource for each space moved.
- Collect Resources: Collect resources from the space where you stopped
- Perform actions: If the location is not controlled by any player, you may freely perform one of the actions for that location. If the location is controlled by another player, you may only perform an action if that player allows it. Actions usually involve exchanging one resource for another, drawing cards, or recruiting units.
- Field units: You may discard a unit card from your hand to add a number of army cubes to one hex equal to that unit's point value.
- Move units: You may move any number of units among the hex your character occupies and adjacent hexes.
- Score units: If the objective condition for any unit card in your hand is met, you may destroy that card in exchange for points. 
- Monster Turn: 
	- Monster strength is increased in one location. If monster cubes are a plurality in that location, the area is *overrun* and its action cannot be used. If monster cubes would be added to an area that is already overrun, all adjacent regions increase monster strength by 1 instead. If those regions are also overrun, the effect cascades outward.
	- Wandering monsters attack one location. Players remove all armies and monsters from that location and put them in the Combat Bag. Players must then secretly bid a number of additional armies to fight in this battle, by dropping them into the bag. A number of armies equal to the monsters' strength are then removed from the bag; these are casualties and are discarded. If a monster is drawn from the bag, it increases the number of casualties by 1 -- e.g. if players are fighting a strength 3 monster, normally they would remove 3 armies from the bag. If the third draw is a monster cube, they must remove 2 additional armies as casualties. Any remaining armies are returned to their owners. If there are fewer armies in the bag than the monsters' strength, the battle is lost and the location is destroyed. The player whose turn it is may discard unit cards in the battle to affect the outcome, who takes casualties, how much damage the monsters do, etc. Cards must be played before drawing any cubes. Their effects may be cancelled by certain events.
- Monster cards may specify that one or more special ability cubes be added to the bag during combat. If one of these cubes is drawn, it triggers an effect.
